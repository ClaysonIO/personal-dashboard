# My Dashboard

This is an incredibly simple PWA-based app that lets me install an app on my phone where I can store a short amount of text. I list out my goals within it, and then use the Digital Wellbeing features of my phone to automatically open the app in the morning. Having a distraction-free app decreases the likelihood that I'll get sucked into something else. 

## Getting Started

If you want to run this, you'll need to do the following:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to test it locally

## Deploying

I use Netlify to deploy this. It's a static site, so it's pretty easy to deploy.

1. Create a new site in Netlify
2. Link it to your GitHub repo
3. Leave everything else as default
